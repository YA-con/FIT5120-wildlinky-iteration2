🔹 It’s a subspecies of the yellow-tufted honeyeater and only survives in a tiny patch of swampy forest in the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve.
🔹 Helmeted honeyeaters are extremely territorial and even attack their own reflections during breeding season!"

🔹 It's incredibly fast and agile — often described as a “lightning bolt of fur” darting through trees.
🔹 They depend on hollow-bearing old-growth trees for nesting, and are highly vulnerable to logging and bushfires."

🔹 They can glide over 100 metres between trees to forage and avoid predators.
🔹 Surprisingly picky — each individual typically sticks to just 20–30 specific eucalyptus trees it uses as a home range."
4,Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby,Petrogale penicillata,Vulnerable,2,Rocky Forest Slopes,Shy wallaby living in rocky escarpments and forests; now confined to isolated colonies.,"Habitat destruction, introduced predators, low population.",https://images.ala.org.au/image/eea6f061-d2db-4607-9c5a-897c2158ef9f/large,"Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby – Photo by Amanda Bryant, via Atlas of Living Australia, licensed under CC BY 4.0",https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/9605957e-396d-43b5-9025-997e1fee039a,"🔹 These rock-wallabies are natural acrobats, living among steep rocky cliffs and bouncing effortlessly across ledges.
🔹 Their thick, furry tail acts like a balancing pole — perfect for navigating their cliffside homes.
🔹 Once common, they’re now endangered due to habitat loss and predation from foxes and cats — but they’ve recently been reintroduced in several protected areas, including in Victoria."
